# student-query
# Student Database SQL Project
# What I Built

I built a Student Database Management System using MySQL to organize and analyze student-related information.
The project includes three main tables:

Students – stores student details like name, age, and email.

Courses – contains course names and instructors.

Enrollments – links students to their enrolled courses and grades.

This database allows efficient data storage, management, and retrieval using SQL queries.

# Why I Built It

I developed this project to understand and apply core database concepts such as:

Database design (using relationships like one-to-many between tables)

Data insertion and manipulation (using INSERT and UPDATE)

Querying and analysis (using SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY)

By building this project, I learned how to extract useful insights from raw data — such as:

Finding which students are enrolled in specific courses

Calculating average grades per course

Identifying top-performing students

This project demonstrates how SQL can transform simple data into meaningful information for academic analysis or management systems.

# How I Built It

Tools Used:

MySQL Workbench for creating and running SQL scripts

MySQL Database for storing student and course data

Steps Followed:

Step 1: Created a database named student_db

Step 2: Defined three tables — Students, Courses, and Enrollments

Step 3: Inserted sample data into each table

Step 4: Wrote SQL queries to:

Retrieve student lists

Join tables to view enrollments
